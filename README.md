# SwiftAddress

This application is designed to be able to efficiently collect housenumbers for OSM. It is still a work in progress. 

## Missing features

* Hasn't been tested on any emulators (I couldn't get them to work). Currently the only device it has been tested on is my own phone (Pocophone F1, lineage os 16)
* "change building levels" dialogs
* Write building levels to OSM file
* Photo note markers + ability to undo
* Audio notes
* menu to change options.
* fix add note dialog showing up when long press is being consumed by one of the arrows
* show are you sure dialog for "save" button
* Be able to request permissions more than once on startup
* Swipe up layout, switch between left and right side.
* Swipe up layout, show gradient on left side if you are on left layout, gradient on right side for right layout
* Display location marker as soon as location is found by device (currently location is only shown on app startup)
* More imagery layers, nicer layout to switch between imageries
* Upload directly to OSM
* addr:interpolation

And probably a few more features I haven't listed here
