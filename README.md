# SwiftAddress

This application is designed to be able to efficiently collect housenumbers for OSM. It is still a work in progress. 

## Missing features

* Hasn't been tested on any emulators (I couldn't get them to work). Currently the only device it has been tested on is my own phone (Pocophone F1, lineage os 16)
* Swipe up on arrow to add previous housenumber + building level
* Centre to current position
* "Modify increment", "change building levels" dialogs
* Write building levels to OSM file
* Photo notes
* Audio notes
* Be able to request permissions more than once on startup
* More imagery layers, nicer layout to switch between imageries
* Upload directly to OSM
* addr:interpolation

And probably a few more features I haven't listed here
