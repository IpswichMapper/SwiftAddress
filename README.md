# SwiftAddress

**WARNING: If you decide to take surveys with this app, please, please test if it works first. Either take a small survey (e.g. a 10 minute one) and open the files in JOSM and check that everything works, or simply add some fake addresses, notes and images and see if you can open this data in JOSM. You could lose data if you don't test that this application works.**

This application is designed to be able to efficiently collect housenumbers for OSM. 

**It is still a work in progress**. 

## Missing features

* Hasn't been tested on any emulators (I couldn't get them to work). Currently the only device it has been tested on is my own phone (Pocophone F1, lineage os 17.1)
* Audio notes
* fix add note dialog showing up when long press is being consumed by one of the arrows
* Be able to request permissions more than once on startup
* Display location marker as soon as location is found by device (currently location is only shown on app startup)
* More imagery layers, nicer layout to switch between imageries (possibly custom imageries too)
* Upload directly to OSM
* addr:interpolation

And probably a few more features I haven't listed here
